# Install & First Run

This page takes you from zero to a completed `ads-bib` run. If you are not
sure which road fits your setup, read [Runtime Roads](runtime-roads.md) first.

## Install

`uv pip` is the recommended installer. If you do not have it yet, install it
once via `python -m pip install uv`, `pipx install uv`, or the platform
installer from Astral.

Install `ads-bib` into the Python environment you want to use. The same
install covers all four official runtime roads:

```bash
uv pip install ads-bib
```

If you are on an NVIDIA / CUDA machine and want the official accelerated
`local_gpu` road, install the validated CUDA Torch wheel into the same env:

```bash
uv pip install ads-bib "torch==2.5.1+cu124" --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

This is the only supported public fallback when the default `torch` install
does not expose CUDA. It is a hardware-class override, not a preset-specific
install path.

## Create `.env`

Run `ads-bib` from the directory that should hold `data/` and `runs/`. That
directory becomes the pipeline `project_root`.

Create `.env` in that working directory. `ADS_TOKEN` is always required; the
other keys depend on the road you pick:

| Road | Required keys |
| --- | --- |
| `openrouter` | `ADS_TOKEN`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `hf_api` | `ADS_TOKEN`, `HF_TOKEN` |
| `local_cpu` | `ADS_TOKEN` |
| `local_gpu` | `ADS_TOKEN` |

```env
ADS_TOKEN=...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...  # only for openrouter providers
HF_TOKEN=...            # only for huggingface_api providers
```

`HF_API_KEY` and `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` are also accepted, but `HF_TOKEN` is
the canonical variable throughout the package.

## Run the CLI

The primary public path is preset-driven:

```bash
ads-bib run --preset openrouter --set search.query='author:"Hawking, S*"'
```

The same preset path is available from Python:

```python
import ads_bib

ads_bib.run(
    preset="openrouter",
    query='author:"Hawking, S*"',
)
```

`ads-bib run` performs a stage-aware preflight before the pipeline starts. It
creates `data/` and `runs/` on demand, downloads the default
`data/models/lid.176.bin` when needed, and resolves the package-managed
`llama-server` runtime automatically for configs that use it. If a required
key, optional dependency, or explicit override is missing, the command stops
early and tells you what to fix.

If you want one editable local config, materialize a preset:

```bash
ads-bib preset write openrouter --output ads-bib.yaml
ads-bib run --config ads-bib.yaml --set search.query='author:"Hawking, S*"'
```

Use `--from`, `--to`, and `--set key=value` to constrain stages or tweak a
preset. [Configuration](configuration.md) is the detailed reference for every
config key.

## Verify Before You Debug

If a run stops early or feels wrong, run the preflight explicitly:

```bash
ads-bib doctor --preset openrouter --set search.query='author:"Hawking, S*"'
```

`doctor` prints the full stage-aware report without starting a run.
`bootstrap` is a separate convenience helper that can write `.env`, materialize
a preset YAML, and download the default fastText model into the current
directory.

## See Your Outputs

After a successful run, outputs live under `runs/<run_id>/`:
